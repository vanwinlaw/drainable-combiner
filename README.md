# drainable-combiner
A Project Zomboid mod that will combine all of a single selected drainable item in the players inventory on a single inventory click. Get away from having to combine each singular item.

## Status
| Mode | Works | Notes |
| ----- | ----- | ----- | 
| Singleplayer | ✔️ | |
| Splitscreen Co-op | ⚠️ - Unverified | |
| Multiplayer | ✔️ | Seems to work fine on 41.66 |


## How
Right click on the drainable item in your inventory and click "Combine All". Your character will go through the process of combining the glue until it is as condensed as possible.

#### Note
This functionality only works for items with a `conConsolidate = true` according to Project Zomboid. Things like Car Batteries/etc will not present the option.

### What's next?
I have intentions to work towards compatability with backpacks/containers.

Use at your own risk. This is just an excuse for me to play around with PZ modding, however I hope others find it useful and that it works as well.
